Help:
- initializing char arrays

Helpful:
Creating Linked Lists:
- Put ListNode and List classes in one cpp file.

Friends:
Options - You may friend classes and functions.
- Ex1. friend class List; // Making Linked Lists
- Ex2. friend ostream & operator<<(ostream &os, const Person &rhs) // Making Overloaded Operators

ifndef:
- Used to define headerfiles
- Ex.
  #ifndef CITY_H
    #define CITY_H
  #include <>
  #include ""
  
  class City
  {
  private:
    .
    .
    .
  public:
    .
    .
    .
  }; // class City
  #endif // CITY_H

Copy Constructor:
- No return value.
- If the right-hand side (rhs) exists, set the left equal to the right.

Static Variables:
- initialize in headerfile: static int count;
- set outside of function in source file: int (class_name)::count = 0;

Overloaded Operator:
- (class_name)::ostream &operator+=(ostream &os, City &rhs);
